# Performance Efficiency Pillar – AWS Well-Architected Framework


## Introduction
The **Performance Efficiency Pillar** focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently and adapting to changing requirements. It involves selecting the right resource types and sizes, monitoring performance, and evolving over time.

## Design Principles
- **Democratize advanced technologies** – Use managed services (AI, ML, analytics).
- **Go global in minutes** – Deploy in multiple regions quickly.
- **Use serverless architectures** – Reduce overhead and increase efficiency.
- **Experiment often** – Prototype, test, and iterate rapidly.
- **Consider mechanical sympathy** – Align design with hardware/OS capabilities.

## Key Best Practices
- Right-size instances with **Compute Optimizer**.
- Use **serverless and managed services** (Lambda, DynamoDB).
- Implement **caching** (CloudFront, ElastiCache).
- Benchmark performance and tune configurations.
- Regularly evaluate **new AWS services**.

## Goal
Maximize performance while minimizing overhead and cost, ensuring systems evolve as demand and technologies change.
