# Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform vs AWS CloudFormation

Manual infrastructure provisioning is slow, error-prone, and unscalable. That’s where Infrastructure as Code (IaC) comes in — enabling you to define your AWS infrastructure using code.

Let’s compare two leading IaC tools in AWS:

🔧 Terraform (by HashiCorp)
Language: HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
Cloud-agnostic: Supports AWS, Azure, GCP, and more
State Management: Uses its own .tfstate file
Modular & Reusable: Supports modules and community providers
📌 Use Cases:
Multi-cloud provisioning
Modularized, reusable infra for large teams
External integrations (Datadog, GitHub, etc.)

🏗️ AWS CloudFormation
Language: YAML/JSON
Tightly integrated with AWS
Manages dependency ordering automatically
Free to use, managed service
📌 Use Cases:
Native AWS-only deployments
Deep integration with AWS services
StackSets for cross-account deployments
