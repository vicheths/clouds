# Reliability Pillar – AWS Well-Architected Framework


## Introduction
The **Reliability Pillar** is about ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently. It focuses on designing systems that recover quickly from failures and adapt to changes in demand.

## Design Principles
- **Automatically recover from failure** – Detect and remediate issues.
- **Test recovery procedures** – Regularly simulate failures.
- **Scale horizontally** – Distribute load across resources.
- **Stop guessing capacity** – Use auto scaling and managed services.
- **Manage change in automation** – Reduce risk with automated deployments.

## Key Best Practices
- Use **multi-AZ and multi-Region architectures** for redundancy.
- Implement **backup and restore strategies**.
- Automate **infrastructure as code** for repeatability.
- Use **health checks and failover mechanisms** (Route 53, ELB).
- Continuously monitor workload health.

## Goal
Achieve high availability and resilience by designing for failure, testing recovery, and adapting systems to workload changes.
