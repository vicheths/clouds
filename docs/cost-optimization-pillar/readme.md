# Cost Optimization Pillar – AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Introduction
The **Cost Optimization Pillar** ensures you run systems that deliver business value at the lowest price point. It emphasizes avoiding unnecessary costs and aligning spend with business priorities.

## Design Principles
- **Implement cloud financial management** – Build capability to manage spend.
- **Adopt a consumption model** – Pay only for what you use.
- **Measure overall efficiency** – Track ROI and business outcomes.
- **Stop spending on undifferentiated heavy lifting** – Use managed services.
- **Analyze and attribute expenditure** – Allocate costs to responsible teams.

## Key Best Practices
- Use **budgets and cost allocation tags**.
- Choose the right **pricing models** (On-Demand, Reserved, Savings Plans, Spot).
- Right-size instances and use **auto scaling**.
- Optimize **data storage** tiers (S3 lifecycle, Glacier).
- Continuously review usage with **Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor**.

## Goal
Align cloud costs with business goals, increase visibility into spend, and maximize cost efficiency.
