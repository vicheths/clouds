# **Overview: AWS Cost Optimization Checklist**

This article provides a structured checklist to help AWS users identify and eliminate unnecessary cloud costs. It highlights common cost inefficiencies across various AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, RDS, S3, and Load Balancers, while offering actionable strategies to optimize spending.

## Key points covered include:

| **Category**                     | **Optimization Strategy**                                        | **Actionable Steps** |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Nonproduction Running 24/7**    | Shut down instances outside business hours                      | Use AWS Instance Scheduler or automation tools |
| **Untagged Resources**            | Improve visibility and tracking                                 | Tag resources by project, owner, and environment (Dev/Stage/Prod) |
| **Idle & Oversized EC2 Instances**| Right-size instances based on actual usage                      | Use AWS Compute Optimizer to identify instances with low utilization |
| **Forgotten EBS Volumes**         | Remove unused storage associated with terminated instances      | Regularly audit and delete unattached EBS volumes |
| **Load Balancers Without Traffic**| Eliminate unused load balancers                                | Monitor CloudWatch metrics; shut down inactive ones |
| **RDS Snapshots Piling Up**       | Retain only essential backups to reduce hidden costs           | Implement backup retention policies; delete old snapshots |
| **Lambda High Concurrency Costs** | Optimize function execution and limit burst charges            | Review concurrency settings; optimize function architecture |
| **S3 Buckets Without Lifecycle Policies** | Control long-term storage costs                               | Configure lifecycle policies to auto-delete old logs; use Glacier where applicable |
| **Data Transfer Charges**         | Reduce unnecessary cross-AZ or public traffic costs            | Optimize VPC endpoint usage; keep workloads within the same AZ |
| **Savings Plans / Reserved Instances** | Commit to predictable workloads for cost savings             | Use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances to reduce On-Demand expenses |
| **No Budgets or Alerts**          | Monitor and control unexpected cost spikes                     | Set up AWS Budgets and CloudWatch alerts in AWS Billing Console |

## Summary: AWS Cost Optimization Checklist
This checklist provides key strategies for minimizing unnecessary spending in AWS environments. It covers automation techniques, right-sizing compute resources, and optimizing storage and networking costs. Users are encouraged to implement tagging for better resource visibility, set up lifecycle policies, and leverage AWS-native cost management tools like Compute Optimizer and Savings Plans.

By following these guidelines, organizations can significantly reduce cloud expenses while maintaining operational efficiency. The article is designed as a practical reference for engineers and cloud administrators who aim to optimize AWS usage systematically.
